HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5 proxies scraper and checker.

- Asynchronous.
- Uses regex to search for proxies (ip:port format) on a web page, allowing proxies to be extracted even from json without making changes to the code.
- It is possible to specify the URL to which to send a request to check the proxy.
- Can sort proxies by speed.
- Supports determining the geolocation of the proxy exit node.
- Can determine if the proxy is anonymous.

You can get proxies obtained using this script in [monosans/proxy-list](https://github.com/victorgeel/proxy-list-update).

## Folders description

When the script finishes running, the following folders will be created (this behavior can be changed in the config):

- `proxies` - proxies with any anonymity level.
- `proxies_anonymous` - anonymous proxies.
- `proxies_geolocation` - same as `proxies`, but includes exit-node's geolocation.
- `proxies_geolocation_anonymous` - same as `proxies_anonymous`, but includes exit-node's geolocation.

Geolocation format is `ip:port|Country|Region|City`.
