# ⚠️  SAFETY WARNING ⚠️

# ⚠️  SAFETY: Lower this value to reduce load on proxy sources
# Max proxies to collect from each individual source
# If the source has too much proxies, then likely many of these don't work
# Set to 0 to disable this limit

# ⚠️  SAFETY: Higher timeout values appear less aggressive to target servers

[checking]
# Website used to check proxy functionality
# Use httpbin-compatible services to get ASN, geolocation and anonymity info
# Examples:
#   "https://httpbin.org/ip"         (or any other httpbin-compatible service) - Supports getting ASN, geolocation and anonymity info
#   "https://checkip.amazonaws.com"  (or any other plain-ip service) - Supports getting ASN, geolocation and anonymity info
#   "https://google.com"             - Checks general connectivity
#   ""                               - Disable checking entirely
check_url = "https://api.ipify.org"

# ⚠️  SAFETY WARNING: High concurrent checks may trigger detection systems!
# For safer operation, consider reducing this to 50-100
# Maximum concurrent proxy checks
# Make sure you have enough RAM first and your network can handle it, gradually increasing the default value
max_concurrent_checks = 4096

# ⚠️  SAFETY: Higher timeout values appear less aggressive and may find more working proxies
# The number of seconds to wait for a proxied request
# Higher values = more working proxies but slower checking
# Lower values = faster checking but may miss slower proxies
